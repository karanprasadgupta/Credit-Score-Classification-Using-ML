# CSE-343_final_project
Credit score classification is a complex problem as it depends upon many parameters and factors.
Payment history, debt-to-credit ratio, length of credit history, new credit, and the amount of credit you have all play a role in your credit report and credit score. All this data is readily available as details of transactions are recorded for all users, and the majority of the youth also use credit cards.
In this project, we want to classify the credit score as good, bad, and standard by using these factors and achieving reasonable accuracy. 
Occupation is also an essential factor for determining the capacity of the user, and many lenders use it for the same. In this project, we are classifying credit scores without occupation as this leads to discrimination, and occupations should be treated equally and with respect. This will also help people with undervalued occupations to get loans if they are eligible.
We will use various preprocessing techniques and different models to achieve maximum accuracy for the classification of credit scores.
